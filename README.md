# Data Analysis Project
This project contains the code and analysis for Project 2. The main goal of this project is to analyze university rankings data.

## Getting Started
To run the analysis, you can download the Jupyter Notebook file (Project_2.ipynb) and open it in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

## Prerequisites
To run the Jupyter Notebook, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you'll need the following libraries:

pandas  
numpy  
plotly  
matplotlib  
seaborn  

### Running the Notebook  
Open the Jupyter Notebook (Project_2.ipynb).  
Run each cell in the notebook to perform the analysis steps.  
## Analysis Overview  
The analysis includes the following steps:  

Loading the dataset.  
Data cleaning and preprocessing.  
Exploratory data analysis.  
Visualizations of the data.  
Correlation analysis between different ranking factors.  
## Results
